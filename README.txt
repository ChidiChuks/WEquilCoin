WEQUIL COIN PROJECT

Creation of a Polygon Network ERC20 token using Remix and Moralis. Solidity as the programming language. One of the feature of this coin is the pay-splitter attribute whereby the payer could initiate payment to the payee without understanding/concerned how tokens are shared between Payee in an assigned ratio. With the help of OpenZepplin the ERCâ€¦


REMIX PROJECT

Remix project is present when Remix loads very first time or there are no files existing in the File Explorer. 
It contains 3 directories:

1. 'contracts': Holds three contracts with different complexity level, denoted with number prefix in file name.
2. 'scripts': Holds two scripts to deploy a contract. It is explained below.
3. 'tests': Contains one test file for 'Ballot' contract with unit tests in Solidity.

SCRIPTS

The 'scripts' folder contains example async/await scripts for deploying the 'Storage' contract.
For the deployment of any other contract, 'contractName' and 'constructorArgs' should be updated (along with other code if required). 
Scripts have full access to the web3.js and ethers.js libraries.

To run a script, right click on file name in the file explorer and click 'Run'. Remember, Solidity file must already be compiled.

Output from script will appear in remix terminal.
